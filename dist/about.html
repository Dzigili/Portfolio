                <p>I was born on August 20, 1984 and I have ten years of experience of working with ATM machines on 
                    software and hardware maintenance. After all those years I decided 
                    that it is a time to gain a new knowledge and to seek for new challenges. 
                    My interest for the information technologies, keen attention to detail and 
                    dedication to solving any problem brought me to world of software engineering. 
                    For the past three years  I have been studying information technologies at 
                    the Faculty of Applied Management, Economics and Finance, and during the 
                    last year I have attended professional practice at the Digital Cube. 
                    In my resume you can see my project on which Iâ€™ve been working during practice.
